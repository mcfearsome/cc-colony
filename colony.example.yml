  # Example 8: Agent with custom instructions
  - id: security-auditor
    role: Security Auditor
    focus: Review code for security vulnerabilities
    model: claude-opus-4-20250514
    instructions: |
      Your mission is to identify security vulnerabilities in the codebase.

      Focus areas:
      - SQL injection vulnerabilities
      - XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) issues
      - Authentication and authorization flaws
      - Insecure data handling
      - CSRF protection

      When you find an issue:
      1. Document the vulnerability with a clear explanation
      2. Assess the severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
      3. Provide a code example of the fix
      4. Create a task in the task queue for remediation

      Always follow OWASP Top 10 guidelines.

  # Example 9: Agent with completely custom startup prompt
  - id: specialized-agent
    role: Specialized Agent
    focus: Custom workflow
    model: claude-opus-4-20250514
    # startup_prompt completely replaces the default colony prompt
    # Use this when you need full control over the agent's initial instructions
    startup_prompt: |
      # Custom Agent Startup

      You are a specialized agent with a unique workflow.

      ## Your Mission
      Focus exclusively on refactoring legacy code to improve maintainability.

      ## Workflow
      1. Scan for code smells and anti-patterns
      2. Prioritize refactoring opportunities by impact
      3. Create detailed refactoring plans
      4. Implement changes incrementally
      5. Ensure all tests pass after each change

      ## Guidelines
      - Never refactor without tests
      - Keep commits atomic and well-documented
      - Preserve existing functionality
      - Improve code clarity and readability

      ## Communication (Optional)
      While you have a custom startup, you can still use the colony messaging system:
      ```bash
      ./colony_message.sh send all "Starting refactoring on [module]"
      ```

      Now begin your work!

# Optional: MCP Executor configuration
# The executor provides a dedicated pane for running complex multi-tool MCP workflows
# Other agents can send MCP tasks to the executor via colony messages
executor:
  # Enable the MCP executor (default: false)
  enabled: true
  # Agent ID for the executor (default: mcp-executor)
  agent_id: mcp-executor
  # MCP servers for the executor (same format as agent mcp_servers)
  mcp_servers:
    filesystem:
      command: npx
      args:
        - -y
        - "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem"
        - /tmp
    database:
      command: uvx
      args:
        - mcp-server-sqlite
        - --db-path
        - /path/to/database.sqlite
  # Supported languages for MCP execution (default: [typescript, python])
  languages:
    - typescript
    - python

# Configuration Notes:
#
# 0. Repository Configuration (New!):
#    - repo_type: Defines the repository's purpose and role
#      * source: Traditional code repository (default)
#      * memory: Knowledge base for notes, research, context
#      * application: Repository IS an agent application
#      * research: Data analysis and report generation
#      * documentation: Technical writing and docs
#    - purpose: Brief description of what the repository is for
#    - context: Additional information agents should know
#    - This information is automatically included in agent startup prompts
#    - Helps agents understand whether they're writing code, organizing knowledge, etc.
#    - See skills for repo-specific guidance:
#      * .claude/skills/knowledge-base.md (for memory repos)
#      * .claude/skills/agent-applications.md (for application repos)
#
# 1. Agent ID Requirements:
#    - Must be unique within the colony
#    - Can only contain alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores
#    - Used for directory names and messaging
#
# 2. Model Options:
#    - claude-opus-4-20250514 (most capable, slower)
#    - claude-sonnet-4-20250514 (balanced, default)
#    - claude-haiku-4-20250514 (fastest, more economical)
#
# 3. Directory Options:
#    - If not specified: Agent works in git worktree at .colony/worktrees/{worktree-name}
#    - If specified: Agent works in that directory (must exist)
#    - Supports ~ for home directory expansion
#
# 4. Worktree Sharing:
#    - worktree field specifies the worktree name (defaults to agent ID)
#    - Multiple agents can share the same worktree by using the same worktree name
#    - Shared worktrees allow agents to collaborate in the same codebase
#    - Only one worktree is created per unique worktree name
#    - Example: Two code reviewers working on different aspects of the same code
#
# 5. Environment Variables:
#    - env field allows setting environment variables for each agent's pane
#    - Variables are exported before running Claude Code
#    - Useful for per-agent configuration (API keys, database URLs, debug flags)
#    - Variables are shell-escaped for security
#    - Example: Different test environments, feature flags, or credentials per agent
#
# 6. Custom Instructions:
#    - instructions field allows adding custom instructions to the agent's startup prompt
#    - Instructions are appended after the standard colony prompt
#    - Sent automatically to Claude when the agent starts via tmux send-keys
#    - Use multi-line strings with | for longer instructions
#    - Perfect for specialized behaviors, focus areas, or workflows
#    - Example: Security checklist, coding standards, specific testing procedures
#
# 6a. Custom Startup Prompt:
#    - startup_prompt field allows complete replacement of the default colony startup prompt
#    - When provided, this completely overrides the default prompt (role, focus, messaging system)
#    - Use this when you need full control over the agent's initial instructions
#    - You can still include colony messaging commands in your custom prompt if needed
#    - Note: If both startup_prompt and instructions are provided, only startup_prompt is used
#    - Example: Specialized agents with unique workflows, non-colony agents, or testing scenarios
#
# 7. MCP Server Configuration:
#    - Each agent can have its own set of MCP servers
#    - Merges with existing .claude/settings.json in the working directory
#    - Agent-specific MCP servers override repo-level settings
#    - Server name is the key (e.g., "filesystem", "git", "aws")
#    - Required fields:
#      * command: The executable to run
#    - Optional fields:
#      * args: Array of command-line arguments
#      * env: Map of environment variables (for the MCP server)
#
# 8. Common MCP Servers:
#    - @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem - File system access
#    - @modelcontextprotocol/server-git - Git operations
#    - @modelcontextprotocol/server-github - GitHub API access
#    - @modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres - PostgreSQL database
#    - @modelcontextprotocol/server-puppeteer - Browser automation
#    - @modelcontextprotocol/server-aws - AWS operations
#    - @modelcontextprotocol/server-slack - Slack integration
#
# 9. Settings Merging:
#    - If .claude/settings.json exists in the working directory, it's loaded first
#    - Agent-specific MCP servers are merged in, overriding conflicts
#    - Final merged settings are written to .colony/projects/{agent-id}/.claude/settings.json
#    - Claude Code is invoked with --settings pointing to the merged file
#
# 10. MCP Executor:
#    - The executor is a special agent dedicated to running MCP workflows
#    - Other agents can send MCP task requests via colony messages
#    - Reduces token usage by centralizing MCP operations (up to 98% reduction)
#    - Executor configuration:
#      * enabled: Set to true to enable the executor pane
#      * agent_id: Identifier for the executor (used in messaging)
#      * mcp_servers: MCP server configuration (same format as agent mcp_servers)
#      * languages: Supported execution languages (typescript requires Deno, python requires Python 3.8+)
#    - The executor has its own dedicated pane and message inbox
#    - See .claude/skills/mcp-executor/COLONY-EXECUTOR.md for usage guide
#    - Agents submit tasks using: ./colony_message.sh send mcp-executor "Execute MCP workflow: ..."
#    - MCP servers are configured directly in colony.yml (same as agents)
#    - Example:
#      executor:
#        enabled: true
#        agent_id: mcp-executor
#        mcp_servers:
#          filesystem:
#            command: npx
#            args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/tmp"]
#          database:
#            command: uvx
#            args: ["mcp-server-sqlite", "--db-path", "/path/to/db.sqlite"]
#        languages: ["typescript", "python"]
#
